	The menu options will be:
		1. Display all station names
		2. Display the stations with wheel chair access
		3. Display the nearest station to a location
		4. Display information for a station with a specific name
			if there is more than 1 station with the same name, display all the station information with the given name
		5. Modify/Edit a Station
		6. Route from one station to another
		7. Display information for all stations
		8. Add a new station
		9. Delete an existing station
		10. Exit
		
Describe how you will read the input file.
-Create an object for each line(all lines, red, green, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, yellow)
-The first thing that i will do is creating a file for the file to be stored
-Then, i will create a scanner and set it as null
-use the exception to try and catch the file
-Iterate through all the lines in the file

Describe how you will process the data from the input file.
-After we got the data from each lines
-We split each element by separating at the ","
-Set a variable name for every index on each array
-Set all variables to an object call station
	-Classify the line for each station if its in red, green, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange, yellow
	-add the station to the object that we created

Describe how you will store the data (what objects will you store?)
-So I will have an object called station that will have the data for each station(latitude, longitude, etc)
-After we have the object(station), we will store it in CTARoute which is a list of object

How will you add/delete/modify data?
-In the CTARoute class, there will be add, remove, and modify taking a parameter (station)

How will you search the data?
-for adding a station, we will ask the user for the previous and next station
-iterate through each CTARoute, ask for the route that the station is in
-search for the previous and next station, find the larger index and add the station

-for removing station, we will also ask for the station name
-Iterate through all CTARoute
-if we find the station, remove it

-for modifying the station, ask the station name
-iterate though all CTARoute
-if we found the station, ask for all the information of the station

List the classes you will need to implement your application.
-CTARoute, CTAStopApp, CTAStops, and GeoLocation

Test plan:
1. try to print out all of the stations
2. try to print out all the stations with the categorized route
3. Display station with wheelchair and without wheelchair
4. Display the nearest station with a specific latitude and longitude
	(latitude and longitude of one of the station and see if the nearest location is that station)
5. Display the nearest station with a random latitude and longitude
6. Display information of a specific station.
7. Display information of all the stations.
8. Add a new station at the end of the route.
9. Add a new station in between 2 stations.
10. Add a new station in between multiple stations.
11. Modify a station
12. modify the station that just been added
13. remove a station
14. remove a station that just been added to the list
15. Generate path for no transfer
16. Generate path for one transfer
17. Generate path for two transfer
